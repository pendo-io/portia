However, it is possible to include the gateway address as an endpoint. This results in a denial of service, since the endpoint can become stuck in a loop of requesting itself until there are no more available file descriptors to accept connections on the gateway.","cvssScore":7.7,"cvssVector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","cve":"CVE-2020-15114","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/bba60acb-c7b5-4621-af69-f4085a8301d0?component-type\u003dgolang\u0026component-name\u003dgithub.com%2Fcoreos%2Fetcd\u0026utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d7.0.0","externalReferences":["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15114"]},{"id":"5def94e5-b89c-4a94-b9c6-ae0e120784c2","displayName":"CVE-2020-15115","title":"[CVE-2020-15115] etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length vali...","description":"etcd before versions 3.3.23 and 3.4.10 does not perform any password length validation, which allows for very short passwords, such as those with a length of one.
